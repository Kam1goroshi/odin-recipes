        <h3>Recipe</h3>
        <p>For the homemade pasta dough:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Place the flour on your working surface and make a well in its center. Add in the eggs, lightly beaten,
                the olive oil, and the salt. </li>
            <li>Mix with a fork, incorporating a little flour at a time. When the dough starts forming and you aren’t
                able to continue mixing with the fork, start kneading with your hands. </li>
            <li>Firstly, the dough will stick to your fingers but if you knead it constantly for at least 10 minutes,
                you will see it thickening and getting the desired consistency. If you want, you can make the dough in
                the mixer, too. </li>
            <li>When it’s ready (it will have a velvety texture and it won’t stick to your hands anymore), wrap it in
                plastic wrap so that it doesn’t dry, and let it rest for 30-60 minutes. </li>
        </ol>
        <p>For the tortellini:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>In a bowl, mix all of the ingredients for the stuffing well, and set it aside. </li>
            <li>With a rolling pin or a pasta maker, roll out the dough into a thin sheet, 1-2 mm thick, by dusting
                lightly with flour.
            </li>
            <li>With a sharp knife, cut square pieces of the dough, 5x5 cm each.</li>
            <li>Add 1 teaspoon of the stuffing at the center of each square. </li>
            <li>Take a pastry brush and spread the egg wash all around the edges of the square.
            </li>
            <li>Fold into a triangle and make sure that no air is trapped inside the tortellini.</li>
            <li>Then, wrap the triangle around your finger and seal the two small corners together. </li>
            <li>Place the first tortellini in a baking pan lined with parchment paper. Follow the same process for the
                remaining dough.
            </li>
            <li>As soon as you prepare all of the tortellini, 1 hour before cooking them, put them in the freezer (along
                with the baking pan, as they are). This 1 hour will prevent them from sticking together when you add
                them to the pot.</li>
            <li>After freezing them, you can -if you want- divide them into portions, put them in zipper storage bags
                and store them in the freezer for 1 month. </li>
        </ol>
        <p>For the sauce:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Boil the tortellini in plenty of salted water over medium-high heat, for 2-5 minutes (depending on their
                size and thickness) and drain them, keeping a little of the water (50-70 g) where they boiled. </li>
            <li>In a frying pan over medium heat, melt the butter. </li>
            <li>Add the sage, the pine nuts, and sauté for 1-2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add the tortellini into the pan and sauté them for 1 minute. </li>
            <li>Lastly, add a little of the water where the pasta boiled, so to thicken the sauce. </li>
            <li>
                Serve the tortellini right away, sprinkle with grated parmesan, pepper, and garnish with finely chopped
                sage leaves.</li>
        </ol>
