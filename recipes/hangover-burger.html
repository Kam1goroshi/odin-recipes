        <h3>Recipe</h3>
        <p>For the burger patties:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Place a frying pan over high heat.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle the butter over the ground beef, add salt and pepper, and knead well. Divide into 4 patties,
                about 120-140 g each, and put them in the hot pan.</li>
            <li>Press them with a spatula and cook them for 1-2 minutes. Flip the patties over and put 2 slices of
                cheddar on top of each one.</li>
            <li>Cook them for 1-2 minutes. Optionally, you can add 50 g of water into the pan, cover it with a lid, and
                cook for 30 seconds. Remove the patties and set them aside.</li>
            <li>Place another frying pan on heat and add the bacon. Cook it for 2-3 minutes on both sides and place it
                on top of each patty.</li>
            <li>Cut the burger buns in half and put them in the pan. Let them turn nicely golden and remove from the
                heat.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>To assemble:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Place a frying pan over medium heat and add the olive oil. Add the eggs and fry them. Remove and set
                aside.</li>
            <li>Spread the bbq sauce over the bottom buns and place 2 patties with the cheese and the bacon on top.
            </li>
            <li>Place one egg and 1 tomato slice on top of the patties.</li>
            <li>Spread the mayonnaise over the top buns, add the iceberg lettuce, and place the top buns to assemble the burgers. </li>
            <li>Serve with the pickled cucumbers and French fries.</li>
